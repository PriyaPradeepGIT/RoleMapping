Absolutely! Let's refine and **merge your query** with all the best practices we've discussed, including:

* **5-minute rolling window**
* **rejection rate logic**
* **lookup thresholds (`EnvRejLimit`, `EnvVolMin`)**
* Use of `instanceId` as environment
* Clean output

### ✅ Final Splunk SPL Query (Optimized with Best Practices)

```spl
index=cloud_rx_pbm_cloud_claim agg="*stg*" "*Transaction-Summary*" earliest=-5m
| rex field=data.message "Transaction-Summary: (?<tx_json>\{.*?\})"
| spath input=tx_json
| eval environment=instanceId
| stats count as total_claims, 
        sum(eval(transactionResponseStatus in ("A","R","D"))) as rejections 
        by environment
| eval rejectionRate = round((rejections / total_claims) * 100, 2)
| lookup ExcessiveRejectionThresholds.csv Environment as environment OUTPUT EnvRejLimit, EnvVolMin
| where total_claims >= EnvVolMin AND rejectionRate >= EnvRejLimit
| table environment, rejectionRate, rejections, total_claims, EnvRejLimit, EnvVolMin
```

| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `earliest=-5m`                | Ensures we're searching only the **last 5 minutes** of data |
| `rex` + `spath`               | Extracts the JSON from log messages for transaction fields  |
| `eval environment=instanceId` | Aligns your field with the lookup key                       |
| `stats`                       | Counts total claims and relevant rejections                 |
| `eval rejectionRate`          | Calculates rejection % (rounded to 2 decimal places)        |
| `lookup`                      | Brings in thresholds for each environment from your CSV     |
| `where`                       | Enforces **volume minimum + rejection threshold**           |
| `table`                       | Clean output for alerting/reporting                         |

Great question — and a common Splunk admin pain point! Let's walk through **why your uploaded CSV lookup file isn't visible to others**, **even though you set app-level permissions**.

---

### 🔍 1. **You uploaded the lookup file, but others can't see it?**

You're likely experiencing this because of one of these issues:

---

## ✅ Troubleshooting Checklist

### ✅ A. **Lookup file permission is set correctly?**

1. Go to **Settings → Lookups → Lookup table files**
2. Find your file (e.g., `ExcessiveRejectionThresholds.csv`)
3. Click **Permissions**
4. Make sure:

   * **App** is selected (not just Private)
   * **Read** access is given to **Everyone**
   * (Optional) Write access to Admins only

✅ **Why it matters**: Even within an app, permissions can restrict others from seeing or using the file.

---

### ✅ B. **The lookup definition is also shared?**

Uploading the file isn’t enough — you also need to **create a lookup definition** and share that too.

> A **lookup definition** tells Splunk how to use that file in SPL (e.g., for `| lookup` commands).

**Steps:**

1. Go to **Settings → Lookups → Lookup definitions**
2. Click **New Lookup Definition**
3. Choose your App (e.g., `search`)
4. Choose the filename (e.g., `ExcessiveRejectionThresholds.csv`)
5. Give it a name (e.g., `excessive_rejection_thresholds`)
6. Save and **set Permissions** to App-level

---

### ✅ C. **Are users running searches in the *same app* context?**

If you uploaded the lookup in the `Search` app, but someone else is using a custom app (e.g., `claims_monitoring`), they won’t see it **unless:**

* The lookup is **globally shared**, **or**
* The **lookup file is duplicated in their app**

✅ **Best fix**: Use the **Search app** or ensure the **lookup is shared across apps** (requires admin rights).

---

## 🧪 Quick SPL Test

From another user account, ask them to try:

```spl
| inputlookup ExcessiveRejectionThresholds.csv
```

* If it works: the permissions are good ✅
* If it errors out: **permissions or app sharing issue** ❌

---

## 🛠️ Summary Fix Steps

1. ✅ Share **lookup file** at App level (or Global if needed)
2. ✅ Share **lookup definition** at App level
3. ✅ Ensure users are working in the same App context
4. ✅ Use `| inputlookup` to verify access
5. ❌ Don't use **Private** sharing unless you're testing alone

Let me know if you want CLI (`.conf` file) instructions to fix this permanently via `transforms.conf` and `authorize.conf`!
