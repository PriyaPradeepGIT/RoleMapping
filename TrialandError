üîç Most Common Root Causes:
You‚Äôre in the wrong directory on the SFTP server (or don't have write access to it).

File already exists and cannot be overwritten (some SFTP servers disallow this).

The file.getName() has unexpected characters or length issues.

The fis stream is not valid, e.g. file is empty or unreadable.

Permission issue on the remote directory (you can cd into it, but not put).

‚úÖ Fix Strategy
Let's log more details and test step-by-step. Try this adjusted block before calling put(...):

java
Copy
Edit
log.info("Local file path: {}", file.getAbsolutePath());
log.info("File exists: {}, Can read: {}", file.exists(), file.canRead());
log.info("Remote working directory: {}", sftpChannel.pwd());
log.info("Remote upload file name: {}", file.getName());
Then change the put line to use the full path explicitly, as a test:

java
Copy
Edit
sftpChannel.put(fis, "./" + file.getName());
Or even better, specify an alternate name to be sure:

java
Copy
Edit
String remoteFileName = "test_upload.csv";  // hardcode for testing
sftpChannel.put(fis, remoteFileName);
üß™ Test Suggestion
Before uploading, list the current directory:

java
Copy
Edit
Vector<ChannelSftp.LsEntry> list = sftpChannel.ls(".");
for (ChannelSftp.LsEntry entry : list) {
    log.info("Remote file: {}", entry.getFilename());
}
This confirms:

The directory exists

The server is ready

You know if the file already exists

üí° Example: Full Snippet Around put
java
Copy
Edit
fis = new FileInputStream(file);

log.info("Uploading file: {}", file.getName());
log.info("File exists: {}, canRead: {}", file.exists(), file.canRead());
log.info("Remote directory: {}", sftpChannel.pwd());

Vector<ChannelSftp.LsEntry> list = sftpChannel.ls(".");
for (ChannelSftp.LsEntry entry : list) {
    log.info("Remote file: {}", entry.getFilename());
}

String remoteFileName = file.getName(); // or hardcode "test_upload.csv"
sftpChannel.put(fis, remoteFileName);
üõ† If It Still Fails...
Try this to rule out filename/path issue:

java
Copy
Edit
String remotePath = sftpChannel.pwd() + "/" + file.getName();
sftpChannel.put(fis, remotePath);
Let me know what the logs show, especially:

sftpChannel.pwd()

File exists & canRead

File listing

I can help quickly pinpoint the issue based on that!







You said:
my directory I am giving "/Test" should i prefix "/"


ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî this is very important with SFTP: the leading slash makes a big difference.

‚úÖ What does /Test mean?
/Test means absolute path from the root of the SFTP server.

If the SFTP user doesn't have permission to write to /Test, or /Test doesn't exist, you'll get a "failure" error.

üîÑ Try without the leading /
If your SFTP user lands in a home directory, and Test is a folder inside that, use:

java
Copy
Edit
sftpChannel.cd("Test"); // relative to your SFTP home directory
üí° Safer Example:
java
Copy
Edit
// Try relative path first
sftpChannel.cd("Test");

// OR if you're sure it's an absolute path and the user has access
// sftpChannel.cd("/Test");

fis = new FileInputStream(file);
sftpChannel.put(fis, file.getName());
‚úÖ To Confirm the Path Works:
Add this before put:

java
Copy
Edit
log.info("Remote directory: {}", sftpChannel.pwd());
If sftpChannel.pwd() logs something like /home/myuser/Test, you're good.

üõ† If Still in Doubt:
Try uploading directly to . (your home directory):

java
Copy
Edit
sftpChannel.cd(".");
sftpChannel.put(fis, file.getName()); // Just to test if upload works at all
Then move to Test once you're sure the basics are working.

Let me know what your sftpChannel.pwd() prints and I‚Äôll guide based on that!
