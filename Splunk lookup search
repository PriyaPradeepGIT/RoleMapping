To store and use a **lookup file** in Splunk (like your `claim_thresholds.csv`), follow these steps:

## üîÅ **Step-by-Step: Store and Use a CSV Lookup in Splunk**

### ‚úÖ 1. **Prepare the Lookup CSV File**

Example: `claim_thresholds.csv`

```csv
service,threshold_percent
dental,20
vision,25
medical,30
```

Save it locally on your machine.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Upload Lookup File in Splunk**

1. Go to **Splunk UI** > **Settings** > **Lookups**
2. Under **Lookup table files**, click **Add new**
3. Select your **App** (e.g., `Search & Reporting`)
4. **Upload the CSV file** (`claim_thresholds.csv`)
5. Give it a **Destination filename** (e.g., `claim_thresholds.csv`)
6. Click **Save**

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Create a Lookup Definition**

1. Now under **Lookups**, go to **Lookup definitions**
2. Click **Add new**
3. Choose the **App** where you uploaded the file
4. **Name**: `claim_thresholds`
5. **Type**: File-based
6. Choose the uploaded file: `claim_thresholds.csv`
7. Check the box for **"Use in search"**
8. Save it

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Use the Lookup in Your SPL Query**

Now you can use it like this:

```spl
index=claims sourcetype=claim_logs
| bin _time span=5m
| stats count as total_claims 
        count(eval(claim_status="R")) as rejected_claims by _time, service
| eval rejection_rate=round((rejected_claims/total_claims)*100, 2)
| lookup claim_thresholds service OUTPUT threshold_percent
| where rejection_rate > threshold_percent
```

### üîí Security Tip (Production)

* Only give write access to admins or automation accounts
* Store large lookup data in KV Store if the table grows

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Issue                       | Fix                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lookup table not found`    | Ensure it was uploaded in correct App (like `search`) and defined properly |
| `threshold_percent` is null | Check if the `service` values match exactly (case-sensitive)               |
